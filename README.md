# Node.js Framework for DDD (Domain-Driven Design) written on TypeScript

## Motivation

Facing the challenge of escalating complexity in software development, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) offers a proven solution. But, incorporating DDD principles within JavaScript and TypeScript, especially Node.js, can be daunting for developers.

Our DDD framework for Node.js and TypeScript is designed to:

- Simplify DDD implementation, reducing development time and errors.
- Promote Consistency across the codebase, easing navigation and team onboarding.
- Encourage Best Practices for producing maintainable, flexible, and resilient code.
- Boost Productivity by handling boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus on unique aspects of their domain.
- Provide Seamless Integration into existing workflows, bringing DDD benefits without overhauling infrastructures.

Our goal is to bring the power of DDD to the Node.js and TypeScript communities, helping to create cleaner, more robust, and scalable systems.
